## Overview of the Project

### Project: LED Blinking with Ardiuno

### Objective
The objective of this task was to understand and implement the fundamental concept of GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) control using an Arduino. Specifically, the task focused on programming the Arduino to blink an LED at a specified interval, demonstrating basic microcontroller programming, and utilizing a simulation environment (Wokwi) for testing and verification.

### Key Activities
1.Basics of programming an Arduino microcontroller.
2.Understanding of GPIO pins and their configurations.
3.Using simulation tools like Wokwi for embedded systems development.

### Technologies used
1.Arduino Uno:A microcontroller board used for programming and controlling hardware components like LEDs.
2.C++ Programming Language:The language used to write the Arduino code for controlling the LED.
3.Arduino Framework:Provides libraries and functions (pinMode(), digitalWrite(), delay()) for programming the microcontroller.
4.Wokwi Simulator:An online platform used to simulate the Arduino board and its components for testing and debugging.
5.GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output):Used to control the LED by toggling its state (HIGH/LOW) through a digital pin.

### Outcome
The task was successfully completed, with the LED blinking at the desired interval in the Wokwi Simulator.
